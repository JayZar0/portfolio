              I started off as a student in electronics engineering with an interest in developing
              robotics. However, I found myself struggling with hardware development. Eventually,
              I shifted toward software development due to its similarities with engineering and the
              significant role programming plays in electronics. Since then, I have enjoyed my time
              studying networking, operating systems, software development, database management, and
              project management in the Computer Systems Technology program.
